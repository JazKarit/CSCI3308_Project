# About Coin Counter
Our team, The Cereal Killers, created an app called Coin Counter targeted users who may have difficulty understanding and counting out US currency. Potential users include young children who have not learned how to count currency, international tourists who are unfamiliar with US coins, or anyone who wants to effortlessly count their coins. Our application works by taking in an image of coins laid out on a flat surface and passes it into our python backend that uses image recognition to detect the coins and returns the total value of coins to the user.
